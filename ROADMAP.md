# Roadmap

This roadmap is containing some random ideas on how to go forward with the projects. Ideas can be removed or added.

- Refactor the code to handle pytorch-lightning >= 0.9.1
- Try to move into full generative territory and recover the full world model on the full dataset
- Why not try to use a categorical latent space?
