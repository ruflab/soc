# Roadmap

- Fix the regularization fields problem
- Grid search the learning rate?
- Implement history_length/future_length for sequential models
- handle the roll_dice to avoid penalizing the model trajectories due to randomness?
- Change the JAVA to have an column counting players full turn
- Work on the JAVA repository to include and align soclog files. The goal is to end up with a well-formated DB schema.
- Add a dataset to handle this new training data.
- Check SWA update: https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning/issues/1894
