# GPU resnet 18

Building on the positive results from the resnet18 experiement. We explore the capacity of 2 different sequential neural networks to learn to predict future state and actions.
- The first one is a conv_lstm where all usual lstm operations have reen replaced with a convolution.
- The second one is a conv3d model padded to predict the future

### Task
Learn to predict future states and actions from past states and actions.
One timestep is the tuple (state, action).
The model receive the ground truth at every timesteps.

Note:
- The game is settlers of catan
- The input is a full sequence minus the last timestep
- The output is a full sequence minus the first timestep

### Hypothesis
The 2 sequential models can learn to predict the next states states and actions of the game settlers of catan for a fixed set of robot player up to 95% accuracy


### Results
I believe some HP tuning is necessary before umping to conclusions.
