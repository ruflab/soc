# Testing the fusion module

This experiement explore if the fusion module is able to improve the prediction capacity of our model for the states relying on text information.

### Task
Learn to predict the next state and actions from past states and actions.
One timestep is the tuple (state, action).

Note:
- The game is settlers of catan
- The history length is 16
- The future length is 1
- We are especially looking a accuracy after trade actions. Those state contains meaningfull chat information that should be fusionned with the latent state of the game observation to improve prediction capacities for this particular action.

It is interesting to note that without chat information the prediction is stochastic as we do not know what has been traded and have to guess it. On the other hand when chat is added, the prediction becomes deterministic has the chat negotiations contains all there is to know about the trade.

### Hypothesis
A fusion module can fusion information from text and tabular data to improvate the model predictive capacity.

### Results
